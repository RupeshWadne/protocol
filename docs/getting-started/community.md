# Community and resources

## DAO

If you're a builder, or you're looking to participate in the Rarible Protocol DAO, here are a few valuable places you'll find support and like-minded builders.

* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rarible) is one of the main places where the DAO is being organized, and builders take their first steps towards building with the protocol.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/rarible) is where everything lives. Since we are open-source, many resources and help from other builders are available there.
* [OpenAPI](https://multichain-api.rarible.org) is where we document the current API capabilities.
